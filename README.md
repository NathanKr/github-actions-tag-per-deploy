<h2>Motivation</h2>
You deploy your app to production and want unique tag for each deploy. This is not in the manner of major.minor.xxx which is set manually and not neceseraly when deploy to production.

Why do u need this autogenerated ?
- becasue app deployed to productiom have bugs so you need to relate these bug to the version it was deployed
- because you want to see in admin page the current unique version
- because you might need the version of disclaimer for documenting version of disclaimer sign bu people login. so the tag can identify uniquely the content signed on
